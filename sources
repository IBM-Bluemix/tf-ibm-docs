<td>MySQL is probably the most popular open source relational database in the world; it debuted in 1995 and rapidly became an essential part of the internet&#39;s infrastructure as a component of the LAMP stack. Since then it has been constantly evolving under different owners. With a broad subset of ANSI SQL 99 and a wide set of its own extensions, including JSON document, full text search and updatable views, MySQL offers a rich palette for developers to draw on in their applications. Administrators will also find a wide selection of database management tools that can work with MySQL. IBM Compose for MySQL makes MySQL even better by managing it for you. This includes offering an easy, auto-scaling deployment system which delivers high availability and redundancy, automated no-stop backups and much more. Note: Compose via Bluemix does not give access to the Compose UI at this time, see https://help.compose.com/docs/bluemix-compose-support for more details.</td>
