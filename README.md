# Objective

To provide an alternative theme for the [IBM Terraform fork](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/terraform) static site and to automatically generate multiple static sites for all release targets.

# Current Release Targets

The documentation landing page (what is shown when you https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/tf-ibm-docs/) presents the documentation for whatever version that Schematics is currently using. This is controlled in the `.build.sh` script via `SCHEMATICS_VERSION` and `SCHEMATICS_REPO` variables.

From https://github.ibm.com/blueprint/bluemix-terraform-provider-dev/releases (Internal):

# Adding Release Targets

- First, update the "[Current Release Targets](#current-release-targets)" section of this README.
- Modify the [`build.sh`](./build.sh) script `INTERNAL_RELEASES` and `EXTERNAL_RELEASES` arrays with the new values.
- Update [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) with the `./source/$VERSION` directory, where `$VERSION` is the value you've added to `build.sh`
- To change the landing page version (what version Schematics uses) update the `SCHEMATICS_VERSION` and `SCHEMATICS_REPO` variables in [`build.sh`](./build.sh).
- Update `./source/_inject-schematics.md` to indicate which version Schematics is using and is being presented to the user on the landing page.

# Resource Categories in Side Navigation

The side navigation contains "categories" or "headings" which group together resources. Items such as "Cloud Foundry Resources" and "Container Data Sources". These categories **ARE NOT** dynamic and must be manually created, updated, or deleted. The code for doing this is contained in [`./source/layouts/sidenav.erb`](./source/layouts/sidenav.erb). Both the inline code block at the top and the array loops inside the HTML will need to be updated.

# Injected Content

For the landing page of each version (including the default as seen at `/index.html`) some content is injected.

For the default landing page this is a "Documentation" section as defined by [`./source/_inject-schematics.md`](./source/_inject-schematics.md) with some additional dynamic markdown generated by `build.sh` at "compile" time.

For the `/<version>/<index>.html` landing pages, this also includes a section about "Developing Locally" as defined by [`./source/_inject.md`](./source/_inject.md) and [`./source/_inject-v1.md`](./source/_inject-v1.md). There are two versions of this file because the provider changed the way users declare the provider block in terraform between versions.

# Building and Publishing

The docs are manually built and deployed from a local workstation by executing the [Building static site](#building-static-site) and [Publishing the static site](#publishing-the-static-site) sections. The workstation that meets the requirements in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## Prerequisites

- `git` must be available on the workstation running the script
- `git` must be configured to checkout from both github.com and github.ibm.com (for older documentation)
- `git` must be able to push to https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/tf-ibm-docs
- For OSX XCode command line tools should be available, on OSX run `xcode-select --install`
- Ruby `2.3.3` or higher is required, I recommend using https://rvm.io/ to manage ruby versions & installation
- `bundler` must be available, on OSX run `gem install bundler` after installing Ruby

## Testing locally

- Execute the `./build.sh` script
- Change into the build directory: `cd build`
- Run your favorite lightweight web server, I prefer Python's: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` but any web server will do
  - You cannot use `bundle exec middleman server` from the parent directory; it will not be inclusive of a number of actions take by the `build.sh` script
- Point a browser at `http://localhost:$PORT/` where `$PORT` is whatever your web server is configured for.

### CAVEATS

Certain links will NOT work locally. They are prefixed with `tf-ibm-docs` for deployment on GitHub pages. To work around this, you can the contents of the `build` directory and place everything inside a new directory `tf-ibm-docs` inside of the `build` directory and then run your web server from `build`. If you do this you will need to point your browser at `http://localhost:$PORT/tf-ibm-docs/` where `$PORT` is whatever your web server is configured for. **DO NOT DO THIS AND THEN RUN `./publish.sh` IT WILL BREAK THE SITE**

**This is known for local dev and simply must be worked around for now** _We will work on fixing this for the future_

## Building static site

- Execute the `build.sh` script
- Successful output will look something like:
- Static file will be placed in the `./build` directory
- The `./build` directory will be copied to `./docs` for publishing on GitHub pages (this may be temporary)

## Publishing the static site

- Execute the `/.publish.sh` script - this will push to GitHub
