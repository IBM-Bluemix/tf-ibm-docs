# IBM Cloud Provider

The IBM Cloud provider is used to manage the provisioning and orchestration of IBM Cloud resources with the Terraform (tm) opensource provisioning engine. The provider must be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation menu on the left to read about the available data sources and resources.

See the section [Using Terraform with the IBM Cloud Provider](#using-terraform-with-the-ibm-cloud-provider) for information on how to install and configure the IBM Cloud Provider.
